# SpecialMart

A gift marketplace that explores the profound question of giving through technology. Built for the Digital Storytelling Class at Columbia University.

SpecialMart uses camera technology and existential reflection to invite users to confront the meaningful choice between giving to loved ones and treating themselves—exploring consumerism, love, and what it truly means to give.
